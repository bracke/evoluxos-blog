I have had plenty of spare time during the last few weeks due to the Covid-19 lockdown. I have made a lot progress and have implemented the basic infrastructure of the system API.

The next step is to connect the API to X11 and implement the gadgets and window objects using X11 functionality.

It will be nice to actually se something on the screen (apart from code). Thus the next update might include screenshots!

I have created this blog, to document the progress and to help motivate me further.
